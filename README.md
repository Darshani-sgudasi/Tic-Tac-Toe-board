# main info
This project is part of my 15 Projects Challenge, where I aim to improve my frontend development skills by building small but impactful applications. For the second project, I created a mini game-style user interface using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The structure of the project is built with HTML5, while CSS3 is used for styling and hover animations, such as a zoom-in effect on game boxes. JavaScript adds interactivity, allowing the page to feel more dynamic and engaging. To make the interface visually fun, I also included emojis like 🎮😍🔥. Unlike projects overloaded with effects, I intentionally kept this one clean and simple, avoiding sound or bouncing animations, so the focus remains on usability and design.

The project files are organized into three main components: index.html for the structure, style.css for design, and script.js for interactivity. To view the project locally, you can clone the repository, open the folder, and launch the index.html file in any browser.

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create interactive web experiences. Even with basic tools, it’s possible to make interfaces that are fun, expressive, and user-friendly.

You can explore the project further by checking the GitHub repository for source code and the Netlify live demo link for a quick preview in the browser. This small project is a step forward in my journey of completing 15 projects and becoming more confident in frontend development.
